## Project Overview
This project aims to classify images using the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. The primary objectives include obtaining and preparing data, exploring and summarizing it, building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classification, and assessing the model's accuracy while minimizing overfitting.

### Objectives:
- Obtain and load data from relevant sources.
- Prepare data for building a model to classify between 24 different classes.
- Explore and summarize the data.
- Build a CNN model to classify images into twenty-four classes.
- Assess the model's accuracy and minimize overfitting.
- Collaborative work in groups of two using Git for source code repository management.
